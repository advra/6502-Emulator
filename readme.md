## 6502 CPU Emulator

Motivation: The 6502 is used by various emulators including the CHIP8 and Game Boy. This project serves to explore project organization, cross-platform compatible-code and understanding the chip's implementation. (And an excuse to delve as an intro to audio processing in the future)
